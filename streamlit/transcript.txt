Siddharth, good to see you. Come in, come in. Vishnu, thanks for taking the time. Have a seat. No problem at all. So, what's on the agenda today? Well, I wanted to touch the base on the Thompson project. As you know, we are nearing the final stages of development and I wanted to get your input on the sales page.

Excellent. The Thompson's are a big fish and landing this contract would be a major win for the company. Let's hear it.

Absolutely. Our initial thought was to focus on the product's cost efficiency and how it can streamline their production process.

That's a solid starting point. They're a company known for being very cost conscious.

Right. But I was also thinking we could highlight the product's environmental and sustainability features. They've been making strides towards a greener operation recently.

Interesting. That is a good point. They haven't exactly been known for their eco-friendliness but it seems to be a changing tide for them.

Exactly. We could position ourselves as a partner who can help them achieve their sustainability goals while also improving their bottom line. I like it. It shows we've done our research and understand their evolving priorities. What about after-sales support? That's always a concern for big corporations. We've already built a comprehensive after-sales support plan with dedicated technicians and a 24x7 help line. Perfect. That will definitely put them at ease.
